This contract contains logic for 
    1. receiving ethereum sent over the blockchain
    2. keeping track of who (the address) that sent funding and how much they sent
    3. determining the ETH to USD conversion rate
    4. converting the ETH received to the equivalent USD

The fundMe smart contract interacts with another contract located on the blockchain via an interface.
