BITCOIN
------------------------------------------
```
Bitcoin was the first application to take the blockchain technology mainstream (i.e into the limelight and in a meaningful way).

Bitcoin is a sort of digital gold, able to make transactions between users as, almost a kind of, currency. 
```

ETHEREUM
--------------------------------------------
```
Ethereum is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.

Ethereum takes blockchian technology one step further, where you can also build smart contracts or Decentralised Applications (Dapps), Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and more.
```

SMART CONTRACTS
--------------------------------------------
```
Smart contracts are a set of instructions which, when placed on a blockchain, are a self executing pieces of code not run by any centralised intermediary.
```


ORACLES
---------------------------------------------
```
The smart contracts are typically paired with some sort of oracle to access external data and external computation ouside the blockchain.
```

CHAINLINKS
---------------------------------------------
```
Chainlink is the most powerful, decentralised oracle network and allows us to build hybrid smart contracts.
```

HYBRID SMART CONTRACTS
---------------------------------------------
```
Hybrid smart contracts are a combination of decentralised on-chain logic settlement layer, and any decentralised external off-chain data or computation.
```

DECENTRALISED APPLICATIONS
---------------------------------------------
```
Decentralised Applications (Dapps) are applications powered by Ethereum.
```

DECENTRALISED AUTONOMOUS ORGANISATIONS
---------------------------------------------
```
Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) are organisations that live online in smart contracts. They are similar to a regular organisaton in the traditional world. However, they have people who hold governance tokens to make voting decisions, etc. They do all their governance on-chain, on this decentralised settlement layer.
```


FEATURES | ADVANTAGES OF BLOCKCHIAN AND SMART CONTRACTS
-------------------------------------------------------
```
1. Decentralised
    There is no centralized source that controls the blockchain. The individuals that make up blockchain are known as node operators. They are the independent individuals running the software that connects the whole blockchain together.

2. Transparency and Flexibility
    Everything that is done on a blockchain and all the rules can be seen by everyone.

    This doesn't, however, mean that everything you do is tracked. The blockchain is pseudo anonymous, so you can create different accounts and interact with them in different ways.

3. Speed and Efficiency
    Since blockchains are verified by a decentralised collective, the settlement (or withdrawal period) can be substantially faster than traditional banks,and depending on the blockchain you are using, can range from 10 minutes down to a couple of seconds.

4. Security and Immutability
    Blockchains are immutable. This means they can't be changed, and as a result, they can't be tampered with or corrupted in any way shape or form. This gives us massive security on our data and transactions.

    If several nodes  go down, so long as just one node on the entire system is running, your data is safe and secure. There are thousands - or hundreds of thousands - of nodes running these blockchain softwares.

    "Hacking" the blockchain is nearly impossible and substantially harder than hacking a centralised system.

    In terms of assets, instead of having gold in a vault or contract written on a piece of paper or computer, your asset is locked on the blockchain forever. And all you need to access it is have a private key or pneumonic (essentially a password).

5. Remove Counterparty Risk
    Smart contracts remove the massive conflict of interest traditional agreements have. They allow us to move from political brand based agrrements to secure Math based agreements.

6. Allow for Trust Minimised Agreements
    Smart contracts allow us to engage in trustless and trust minimised agreements.

MAINNET vs TESTNET BLOCKCHAINS
---------------------------------------------
```
A testnet blockchain is a network where the currency doesn't have any real value but resembles and acts exactly like ethereum mainnets so we can test our applications. Testnets are free.

Mainnets cost money and are considered "live".
```

FAUCET
---------------------------------------------
```
A faucet is atestnet application that gives us free test tokens, like the free test Rinkeby Ethereum.
```



Gas
---------------------------------------------
```
Gas is a unit of computational measure. 

The more complex your transaction is, the more gas you have to pay.
```


Gas Price
---------------------------------------------
```
Cost per unit of gas specified for the transaction, in Ether and Gwei.

The higher the gas price the higher chance of getting included in a block.
```



Transaction Fee
---------------------------------------------
```
Amount paid to the miner for processing the transaction.

When we make transactions, the "miners" or "validators" make a small fee called the transaction fee, given by:

Transaction fee = Gas Price X Gas Limit & Usage by Transaction
```


Hash
---------------------------------------------
```
A unique fixed length string meant to identify a piece of data. 

They are created by placing said data into a hash function.

Etgereum uses the Keccak-256 hashing algorithm.
```


Genesis Block
---------------------------------------------
```
The First block in a blockchain.

The genesis block's "previous hash" points to a block that doesn't exist.
```


A malicious network provider can lie about the state of the blockchain and record your network activity. Only add custom networks you trust.
